Ani-Py is a python program to browse and watch Anime. It uses <a href="https://www1.gogoanime.pe/">gogoanime</a> to get all anime and mpv to for playing the video.

Inspiration for this project was taken from <a href="https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli">ani-cli</a>. Only down side it had though was you can only run it on linux. But this program will run on windows and linux (atleast that's what I'm planing).
